Docker is a great way to test projects without having to install libraries and dependencies as the Docker image will include everything you need to run the program. Just simply pull project from Docker hub and run it.

So let’s assume we have a situation where we want to test some project that you can access from Github or from Docker hub.

If we go from the Github route now you have to pray that there is a good enough documentation so that you know what libraries you need. Assuming that there isn’t a good documentation you will now need to figure out what you need by looking at the code which can be really time consuming. In this situation you are prone to install many things that aren’t needed for the project. Even in the case of having good documentation you might still install too many or wrong libraries etc. and end up with errors that need to solve before getting everything running.

Now if we go for the Docker route instead only things we have to do is to install Docker which is rather straightforward as shown by the course and then pull the image from Docker hub. Now everything you need for the project to work is installed and you can run the program easily. This will save you a lot of time and headache.
